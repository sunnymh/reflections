The thing I like the most about this week is that we now know what each group is doing for the final project. We are now working as groups and cooperate across groups for the tasks assigned.  
Right now, everyone sees finishing the project as the main goal for the reset of the class. And I could see that we will be able to learn a lot from this project. But I'd suggests that the instructor and GSIs introduce us to some new tools during the lecture. And for the groups, we should share what we learned, and packages or tools we discovered while doing the project. Since each group is doing something different, and most of us are doing the task which we are already strong at, it will be helpful if we can learn from each other.

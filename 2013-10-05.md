**What we did this week:**  
For the lecture on Tuesday, we went over the idea of collaboration as groups and among groups. For each group, people take part in the project taking roles as curator, analyzer, visualizer, presenter to format, analyze, visualize and present the data. And people performing the same role in different groups can work together to provide a vertical perspective of the project. We also discussed about the tools, skills, responsibilities, outputs, communication, technique, stack(workflow) required for each our groups.

For the lecture on Thursday, Professor Stark gave us more information on the Earthquake prediction problem. He introduced to us some common statistics models and hypothesis testing methods, which are helpful for our group project.  

We are also starting on our first group project on analyzing the questionnaire we did at the beginning of the semester. It is a good practice for us to get start on using the statistical analysis tools.
    
**My thoughts:**  
The idea of people taking different roles in a group and collaborate across group is pretty helpful as it is a good way for us to improve efficiency, since everyone has a clear goal of what he is going to do and how he is going to accomplish is. However, this strategy might potentially hurt the communication among group members. Because the project is assigned to each group member in a top-down pattern, people might get the illusion that one need only to talk with the group member who worked one step before him to work on his own part, which is not true. In Stat 133, professor suggested us to do some basic plots and tables as a way to do initial analysis, which means that visualization may occur before analysis. Also, the way we parse the data depends a lot on what analysis we want to do. For example, we might initially want to see what classes people take before taking stat157 but later decide to take only STAT classes into account. In this case, the Curator should take the role again to make STAT and non-STAT classes two separate columns. Thus there should be a lot of conversations going on during the project, and each group member's role will interleave.

**What we did this week:**  
On Tuesday, we went over some Python functions to be use in our project, which is pretty helpful. On Thursday, we explored some more models for earthquake prediction. I'd say those concepts are pretty challenging for most people. As we can see from the questionnaire, only two third of the people have taken Stat 135. Even though I have taken that class, What professor Stark mentioned is still new to me. I might have seen those concepts in class, but they were definitely not stressed enough in my class. I kind of feel that Stat 135 is too theoretical that we don't actually have a chance to practice the ideas. Almost all my homework in stat135 are problem sets. It would be helpful if I did have some projects to apply those ideas in real world problems. We have a project this week to convert the earthquake data from Jason to CSV file. It seems like due to the version problem, most people can't use the read_jason() function. So I can foresee that they can't reproduce the data from groups which do use that function, which is going to be a problem.   

**Reproducibility issues due to version and system difference**  
As mentioned above, since not everyone can use Jason_read() function due to the version of Ubuntu, it is going to be a problem for reproducibility both within my group and across groups. And is is not uncommon. There were times I found in surprise that some R packages don't have a Linux version or the Linux version has the dependency issue. Once, I had to do part of my R project in Linux and the other half in Window, which is pretty annoying. What make it worse is that the community sometimes don't try to fix the issue, but discard the package completely. In order to solve this issue, some of my CS classes provides us a VM at the beginning of the class with everything installed. I have seen this kind of VM a lot outside of class as well. So I feel it is pretty interesting that nowadays, thanks to the low cost for storage and the high speed of internet, we need a VM for every project to ensure reproducibility. And the main reason we use VM is not that we want protect our local environment, but to get over with the drawbacks of the software/package itself. So I was kind of wondering if the software/package itself is not robust enough to work across platforms in the long term, is it a wise choice for us to use it?

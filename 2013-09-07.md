**What I found challenging this week is finding the information we want online.**  
For IRC and VM, there are a lot of documentations, so it was pretty easy for me to find detailed instructions for setting up IRC and VM, and there are a couple of beginner's tutorials I can refer to. However, online documentations for SSH to VM and connecting to iPython server are quite limited. The methods provided online may only be suitable for one particular OS, and the authors assume that the readers have sufficient knowledge about networking. When they talk about port forwarding or adding endpoint, I don't actually know what they are talking about, so it was hard for me to adapt their method for other type of VM or Mirror to my own VM. For this problem, I tried various methods as suggested by those documentations and searched for the terms they mentioned in their tutorial. Now I have a temporary solution that I can use iPython during lecture, which is to use an older desktop version Ubuntu VM. However, Aaron suggests that it won't be a long term solution for the class. So I hope I'd be able to set up iPython at Aaron's office hour next week.

**I learned a couple things that might be potentially useful for my other classes as well:**  
1. For the team project last semester, we had tried to let each team member to commit to his own branch and merge the branches at the end. However, having one team member as the admin and the other members fork from the admin might be a better idea. Since this is a better version control model used industry as well.  
2. It's the first time I use IRC, and it's pretty interesting. However, I'd suggest using XChat rather than Pdgin, because XChat is for IRC only while Pdgin might be used for many chatting tools. So I got quite confused at the beginning when I installed Pdgin. I felt like I was learning Outlook without knowing what email is. The other thing I was wondering about IRC is that when I accidentally close IRC and restart it, I can't see the chat history while I was away. This has happened several times.  
3. I never used server version Linux before. So it might be a good opportunity for me to remember the shortcuts for Emacs or VIM eventually. 

**Some links that has been useful for me:**  
[This](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/python/tutorials/ipython-notebook/) link seems to provide a tutorial on how to connect to iPython server for Windows even though I don't quit understand it.  
[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) is pretty helpful for understanding what is IRC.  
[This](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6286571/git-fork-is-git-clone) is a pretty helpful illustration for the difference between git fork and git clone  
[This](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) demo is great for iPython.

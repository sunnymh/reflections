Sorry I didn't update my reflection and I didn't come to class on Tuesday because I had been extremely busy since last Wednesday due to a CS164 project. Basically before it was due on Nov 21, I spent 8 whole days on that project except a few hours' sleep each day. I need to say thanks to all my group members for taking over everything and make sure everything is on the right track. I tried to sync with my group members on Thursday's lecture and read over the notes from Tuesday about the talk with Leun. From my understanding,  
1). my group has to wait for Leun's response to take the next step on the MDA model.  
2) While waiting for Leun's response, we came up with another approach to try to understand the data.

Because we have only 3 lectures left for the semester, I feel like we should set a smaller and more achievable goal for now. The goal for the class is 1).reproducing everything from ETAS and MDA model. 2) interpreting the two models and 3) come up with a better model. However, I really doubt about the part about creating a "better modal", since the majority of us lack the knowledge required on hypothesis testing. By looking at only the error diagram or the result on existing data, we cannot assert that our model is good, or even correct. We talked about issues as overfitting, and we came up with solutions as cross validation or taking machine learning approach. However, only few students have learned about these methods before. Even though I have some experience working on cross validation, linear modeling and I took a class related to machine, I don't think I can take it over unless under the guidance of a professor or PhD student who have rich experience in dealing with all sort of edge cases. And it might talk a whole year of work stepping back and forward all the time checking all kinds of constraints on the methods we used and the limit of the data to make sure our conclusion is solid.

Due to the reasons above, I think for now, we shouldn't be worried too much on the "better" model over MDA or ETAS. Roman is not built in a day. We need to have a skeleton first, for that I mean we should have something work in the first place and then try to make it better latter on. The formula for window size can be as simple as a exponential distribution for now. But we should have the functions on drawing error diagrams using different parameters and conducting cross validation. We need to make sure our code is completely reproducible, so that given any set of windows sizes, we can use the same/similar code to examine on the new model. If we have this part ready, we can put all of our effort on creating the new models. And we can compare the models by simply looking at the plots created. If the plots are not as persuasive and we hoped, we can always improve our plots.

I'll talk with my group members tomorrow and see what they thinks. But something I can do for now is to write some simple skeleton code. So given a set of earthquake data, and the window size calculated by some model, I can draw the error diagrams using my skeleton code. I hope it will be helpful for everyone else in the class.

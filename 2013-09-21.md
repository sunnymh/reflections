**What we did this week:**  
For the lecture on Tuesday, we had a guest lecuture from Eric Berlow about Toads in Yosemite National Park, which is really helpful for me to learn about data gathering and applying statistic models. After taking 5 courses in STAT department, I have to say I'm still not confident enough to conduct statistical analysis on a real life problem. Even though I haven been given more than 10 projects in my precious classes, what I did was to do analysis using the required method on given dataset. So I never designed a survey or collected any data myself, nor did I ever doubt about the validity of the data I have. I learned a lot from Eric's experience on how they due with the lack of data.

For the lecture on Thursday, Professor Stark gave us a quick review/intro to hypothesis testing base on different models, which will be used in our earthquake project. I'm looking forward to practicing these methods in our project. When I took STAT 135, I felt hypothesis testing was hard, and I was wondering when I would actually use all those tests. After taking some more classes and doing a few more project, I hope I could take STAT 135 again because I realized that memorizing only the formula won't help me to solve a real life problem. 
    
**What I found challenging this week:**  
Definately I should have a quick review on what I learned in STAT134 and STAT 135, because I almost forget t-test, and I can't remember what a poisson process is. I hope we could have some more review on these concepts before staring on the project.

The other thing would be port setting. I wasn't able to make to Kristina and Chris's office hour on Friday. I'll try to figure out the port for guest and host thing next week.  

**I learned a couple things that might be potentially useful for my other classes as well:**  
1. The way to gather research data.  
2. The way to do hypothesis testing.
3. Port setting.

**Some links that has been useful for me:**  
[This](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/) link is helpful for figuring out the right hypothesis testing model to use.  
[This](http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/ports.html) is a good instruction on port setting.

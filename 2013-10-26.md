**What we did this week:**  
On Tuesday, we conducted a code review for the project on earthquake feeds. When looking at the issue tracker, I saw several people claims that they met the problem as the cache not being found while testing other groups' projects. My guess is that they use the "Cached data" option when they run the code for the first time. Definitely no cache can be found in this case since the data hasn't been stored yet. Facing this circumstance, two questions came to my mind:  

**First, are the reviewer provided sufficient amount of information on how to test the code?**  
Some groups provided a default cache while other groups not. Thus should each group mention in their README file what will happen in each case either the cache is found or not?  

**Second, is iPython notebook a good tool for interactive user input?**  
I still don't like iPython notebook that much due to the fact that code and results are presented on the same page and no interactive user input is supported. There woun't be a problem if the user never has to change the code. However in the case of our project, we do need to make the decision whether we want to use Live Data or Cached Data. In other programming languages, we can make it as a arguement, and the program could potentially return a error message if the arguement is invalid. However, in iPython notebook, the user has to touch the code to reflect his choice. If the user ever has a chance to touch the code, there is the possiblity that he changed the wrong part of the code, which might broke the whole code completely. Due to this reason, I think iPython notebook should provide a option as root permission so that user can only modify some particular cell of the code unless the creater provide him a pin for permission. Also an error output cell is necessary at the begining of the program. In the case that the user entered invalid input or the progame encounteres an exception, we want this message to be available to the user immedately rather than for the user to scroll down the code to find the cell which returns the invalid output.  

On Thursday, we conducted a horizontal group evaluation. As a member for visualization, I was startled that I was among the only two people in my group who have experience in Python before. And the other people have relied a lot on their vertical group members who have experience in Python to do their part of the project. From my personal experience, I think it is actually quite challenging for people to learn a programming language by themselves if they are not already familiar with one or two programming languages. However, asking those people to either teach those people who have no experience in Python before or doing a larger portion of the project is equally unfair. I guess for a upper division STAT class, we can only assume that people are already familiar with R. If this class will heavily depend on Python skills, Python should be listed as a prerequiste for this class so that only people who are familiar with python will take this class, or we should be provided at least a month's lecture to make sure everyone has the proper skill to use Python, which will potentially cause those people with Python experience to withdraw from the class. A decision should be make for this class in its later semesters. Now it is a burden for both students with Python experience and students without Python experience.

**What we did this week:**  
For the lecture on Tuesday, we did the presentation for our first project. I learned how to used iPython notebook through this project, and it is definitely a good way to present some result using Python. And from the presentation, I can see how different groups approach and solve a problem. And on Thursday, we tried to run other group's code by reading their instructions. It's really startling to see how important documentation is. Some concerns of mine:  

**R and Python as statistical analysis tool and reproducibility**  
Of all the 11 groups, only 2 groups used Python for visualization, and one of them used the R interface. I guess the top reason for us to choose R is that we are already proficient in using it. However, I looked over the library of iPython for plotting and analysis as well. I feel like the python packages are not as easy to use as R. R has more build-in algorithms for statistical analysis and packages for plotting. And the fact that most functions in R are vectorized make it a convenient tool for parsing the data. I looked over some [discussion about R and python for statistical analysis](http://www.biostars.org/p/72173/) as well. It seems to me that many people have a strong preference for one over another, and it all depends on which language people get exposed to first and how familiar people are with the language. Due to this reason, I think using R for my projects should be my best choice.  

As required for this project, we need to use python to access the data. When I tried to use iPython Notebook together with R, some problem occurs. We have the code for parsing the data in Python, the code for analysis and visualization in R. Thus we have to run the Python code from iPython Notebook to get the data, then we need to run the R code in terminal, and at last we need to run some Python code in iPython Notebook again to load in analysis result and plots into it, which is definitely not convenient for reproducing the data. The RPython package in iPython might be able to solve the problem by letting us to run R code in Python. However as it's documentation suggests, it is an interface for users more proficient in Python to use R functionality. If we can provide the clean code in R directly, we shouldn't have done that only in compromise with iPython Notebook.  

In my opinion, what we use for presentation should rely on what we use for analysis rather than the opposite. Thus in retrospect, I think my group shouldn't have used iPython Notebook if it doesn't facilitate our analysis and reproducibility. Instead, we could write a Makefile to run Python and R code in sequence and produce a HTML page to present our result. So if someone want to reproduce the result, he only need to run 'make' in the terminal. And those updates could be reflected in the HTML page too.

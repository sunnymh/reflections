**What we did this week:**  
For the lecture on Tuesday, we got started on iPython notebook. We installed gspread and got introduced to some textbooks that might be helpful. Even though I had some experience with Python, I didn't use it as a statical analysis tool. I was told scripting languages as Perl and Python are powerful for data analytics. And Python, in particular, has a lot of statistical analysis packages. So I hope to see them soon. 

For the lecture on Thursday, we talked about the reproducibility of data. And we focused on the use of VM and importance of keeping data from changing due to environmental influence, which provide me a good explanation of what we were doing for the past four weeks.
    
**My thoughts on reproducibility and the goal for this class:**  
The idea of reproducibility is definitely important for both industry and research. Even though I don't have much experience in either industry or research, I have already messed up my computer or my projects a lot due to the reproducibility issues, and only after these accidents did I start to use git and VM and think about protecting my data. I have to admit that, after taking 5+ project based CS classes, I still sometimes save my project as <Project>_version1, <Project>_version2...as a way to back up my project, and my team emails each other as a way to do version control. These tools are so helpful if you know how to use them. However, it takes time for a person to be an expert. And before that, the tools can sometimes be troublesome. My friend once force push her code to the team repository with conflicts in it. And I have heard of people who accidentally deleted their SVN history. That's why I think a class in reproducible data is important.  

However, I feel like the idea of reproducibility is really hard to be taught, because there is a gap between people understanding the concept and people knowing how to apply them in practice. We spent the last four weeks setting up the environment. That's how we understand the importance of having a VM to keep our environment to be the same. If everyone was using the same Mac with iPython notebook working already, we probably won't appreciate Aaron's talk on the importance of VM that much. Similarly, in my CS classes, The reason I used emailing  and making copies of the project manually as version control, even though I know I should use git instead, is that I was so afraid to mess up my code when a deadline is approaching. The best ways to learn these concept would be through practice, but would we be provided the sufficient amount of time and practice in this class to achieve the goal?

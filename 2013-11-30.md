We only met once this week, but our group is still making progress during the Thanksgiving. Right now, we have reproduced Leun's result and tried four of our own models. And I just wrote two helper functions for testing different models in general. Our group will meet today. We will gather our thoughts together and present them tomorrow. I think my group is pretty much done with creating our own models, the next step for us is to test it on some more parameters. I'm looking forward to hearing from other groups tomorrow.

**What we did this week:**  
For the first lecture, we tried to use another software Vagrant to create and configure the virtual development environment. I was able to install Vagrant, but the same Network problem occurs that I can't access the iPython notebook server from a web browser outside of the virtual machine. It looks like we need to find something else that would be able to get around with the firewall. I never tried to SSH or connect to a server in the virtual machine before. If we could find a quick and easy way to do it, that would be helpful for my other classes as well.  

For the second lecture, we formed our groups and came up with pluses and deltas. I really like the way everyone is on the same pace and we can help each other both inside and outside of the class. We decided to form Facebook group as well to facilitate our communication.  
    
**What I found challenging this week:**  
What I found challenging this week is that it is really hard for us to help each other using different OS. The difference between Windows and Linux has been dramatic. I don't really know how to use cmd and set environment variables in windows after using Linux for three years. Similarly, People using Windows in my group don't really know how to use a Terminal. To make things even worse, different versions of the same OS are different from each other. Airbear2 worked for Ubuntu since the very beginning, however, it only started to work for my Mint machine last week, and I still don't know why it didn't work earlier. Given this reason, I some times feel bad that I can't help other people out even though things are working for my machine. Due to this reason, I was thinking things would be much easier if we were provided a VM with everything set up already at the very beginning.  

**I learned a couple things that might be potentially useful for my other classes as well:**  
1. I learned how to write README files using Github Markups.  
2. I did used some VIM in the Ubuntu server, which is a pretty good exercise to remember the vi shortcuts.     

**Some links that has been useful for me:**  
[This](http://dfilimonov.com/github-markup-preview/) link is really helpful for learning Github Markups.  
[This](http://www.keyxl.com/aaa8263/290/VIM-keyboard-shortcuts.htm) is pretty helpful for learning VIM, which works pretty well for the Ubuntu Server.
